<h1> Process Complexity Matrix using Machine Learning </h1>

<h3><strong> Overview </strong></h3>

<p>This is the full code for <strong>'Process Complexity Matrix by Machine Learning'</strong>. In this demo code, we leveraged Machine Learning and implemented it to create a predictive model that would help assess the complexity rating of a use case for automation. </p>

<h3><strong>Dependencies: </strong></h3>
 <p> 1. numpy <br>
  2. pandas <br>
  3. re <br>
  4. scipy <br>
  5. matplotlib <br>
  6. sklearn <br>
  7. seaborn <br>

<strong>Use pip to install any missing dependencies</strong> </p>

<h3><strong>Usage: </strong></h3>

<p>The model has already been trained and the coordinates of the centroids are already derived which has been used here based on the results of the previous Bot Data which we had

then run the code like so

<strong>python training_dataset_algorithm.py </strong> </p>

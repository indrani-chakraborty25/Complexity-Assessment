Process Complexity Matrix using Machine Learning

Overview

This is the full code for 'Process Complexity Matrix by Machine Learning'. In this demo code, we leveraged Machine Learning and implemented it to create a predictive model that would help assess the complexity rating of a use case for automation. 

Dependencies:
  1. numpy
  2. pandas
  3. re
  4. scipy
  5. matplotlib
  6. sklearn
  7. seaborn

Use pip to install any missing dependencies

Usage:

The model has already been trained and the coordinates of the centroids are already derived which has been used here based on the results of the previous Bot Data which we had

then run the code like so

python training_dataset_algorithm.py
